# Yet another Engine
OpenGL and so on...
## Engine
Garbage and a renderer being able to render just a plane in a space, nothing special.
## gl3w
Just gl3w wrapped to a static library which is included in the Engine.
## New Solutions
That's my playground. Currently I'm working on hierarchy and components system. Very early stage of development.
